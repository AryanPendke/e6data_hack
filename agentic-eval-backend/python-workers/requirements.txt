# Basic dependencies for evaluation workers
# These are minimal requirements - the workers have fallbacks if packages are missing

# Core utilities
numpy>=1.21.0
diskcache>=5.4.0

# Optional ML dependencies (workers will fallback if not available)
# Uncomment and install these for full ML functionality:

#transformers>=4.20.0
#torch>=1.12.0
#sentence-transformers>=2.2.0
#bert-score>=0.3.12

# If you want to install ML dependencies, run:
# pip install transformers torch sentence-transformers bert-score

# The workers are designed to work with just numpy and diskcache
# and will use simple fallback methods if ML libraries are not available
